#+TITLE: The thermodynamics of the dehydration of gypsum

The production of the hemihydrate bassanite from gypsum is an oddity
amongst dehydration reactions. The thermodynamics of this reaction is
here investigated, by combining, comparing and contrasting
calorimetric measurements and data with Raman and IR spectra of the
relevant substances (gypsum, bassanite, and water).

A suite of octave functions and routines help to uncover some of the
reasons behind the peculiarities of this dehydration.
